# Technology

A credit to all the projects and open source packages that have helped during the building of this project. Truly, without these projects, Simple Resume wouldn't exist.

## ReactJS + Hooks ðŸŽ‰

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that weâ€™ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether youâ€™re learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems.

## html2canvas

The script allows you to take "screenshots" of webpages or parts of it, directly on the users browser. The screenshot is based on the DOM and as such may not be 100% accurate to the real representation as it does not make an actual screenshot, but builds the screenshot based on the information available on the page.
